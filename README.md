# hello-world
Welcome to my cyber collaborators
I am Terry, a want-to-be data scientist that has much stronger statistical and analytical skills than computer programming experience.  I have an MBA, a Master in Marketing Research and taken many online data science courses as Coursera, Datacamp and others.
